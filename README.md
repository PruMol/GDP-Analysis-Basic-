# GDP-Analysis-Basic-
* GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is a fundamental metric used by economists and policymakers to assess the size and performance of an economy. It encompasses consumer spending, business investments, government expenditures, and net exports. It is often used to compare economic performance between countries and assess the impact of various economic policies and events.
* This project aims to analyze a comprehensive GDP (Gross Domestic Product) dataset from various countries and time periods. By leveraging data visualization techniques, we have created and interpreted various graphs and charts to gain insights into the economic performance and trends of different nations.
* Concepts implemented: Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Python language and its necessary libraries like pandas, matlplotlib.pyplot, os, plotly.express and plotly.offline
